# Dragon's hoard Exchange

A dead simple D&D currency converter designed to make your adventuring life easier! With this tool, you can seamlessly manage and distribute treasure across your party, convert it into optimal denominations, and even check its real-world value in USD.

## Features

- **Optimal Distribution**: Automatically calculates the best distribution of D&D currencies (gold, silver, copper, platinum) for any input value.
- **Electrum-Free**: Electrum is ignored entirely for a smoother experience (because who likes electrum, anyway?).
- **Party Splitting**: Divide treasure equally among party members, with leftover amounts clearly displayed.
- **USD Conversion**: See the converted treasure value in USD for a fun perspective.
